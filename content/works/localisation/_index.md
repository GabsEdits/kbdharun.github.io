- I think technology must be accessible to everybody, and the best way to make it more accessible is through localisation.
- I started localising various projects to **Tamil** with this goal in mind.
- You can find some of my work in localisation in [**Weblate**](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/kbdharunkrishna).
