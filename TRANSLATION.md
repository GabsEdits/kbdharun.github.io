# Translations

- I think technology must be accessible to everybody through localisation.
- You can find most of my work in localisation in [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/kbdharunkrishna) and [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/kbdharun). 

## Projects that I have contributed translations to

- [Bottles](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles), I translated Bottles (A program to manage wine prefixes and  run Windows software and games on Linux) to Tamil. The translation file can be found [here](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/tree/master/po).

- [tldr-pages](https://github.com/kbdharun/tldr), I translated some commands to Tamil and I review, validate translations in pull requests.

- I translated [Wike](https://github.com/hugolabe/Wike) (A Wikipedia reader for GNOME) to Tamil at POEditor.
