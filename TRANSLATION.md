# My Works in Translation

- I think technology must be accessible to everybody, and the best way to make it more accessible is through localisation. With this goal in mind I started localising various projects to **Tamil**.
- You can find some of my work in localisation in [**Weblate**](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/kbdharunkrishna) and [**Crowdin**](https://crowdin.com/profile/kbdharun).
